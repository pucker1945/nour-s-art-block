                &quot;Claude Monet&quot; referenced from the original by John Singer Sargent <br /><br />The story
                behind this is a rollecoaster from start to finish, Nour had gone on a school trip to a book fair where
                she met a girl called Malak. Malak was a very sweet girl who gave Nour and her friends free bookmarks
                and sketchbooks. After Nour showed Malak her art page, Malak insisted Nour signs up to an art course and
                in 1 month&#x27;s time Nour was able to recreate this masterpiece in her own eyes.</p><img

                arrogance. This amazing portrait is in fact a birthday gift she worked so hard on just for a very dear
                and special friend. Nour has always been loved by everyone around and she never failed to show that love

                her tears fell on the portrait she decided to use that to project the bad mental health she had at the

                <br /><br />It was a very impulsive painting, she wanted to combine elements that she loved which were
                fantasy themed girls and clouds and she has a very repetitive pattern with using clouds in her
                paintings, she thought the contrast of the white hair with the dark skin made a beautiful combination.
                and the transition from the hairline to the clouds, like colored people have such fluffy hair that
                reminded her of clouds. The diversity and beauty in her painting are simply jaw droping.
